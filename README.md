### LXD/LXC Agents

*NB: Guests using systemd are not currently supported if running lxd containers unpriviledged.

#### Ubuntu Trusty
```bash
$ lxc launch images:ubuntu/trusty/amd64 ubuntu
$ lxc config device add ubuntu partout disk path=/opt/partout/agent source=/home/bev/Documents/Brackets/partout/agent
$ lxc exec ubuntu bash
```

#### CentOS 6
```bash
$ lxc launch images:centos/6/amd64 centos6
$ lxc config device add centos6 partout disk path=/opt/partout/agent source=/home/bev/Documents/Brackets/partout/agent
$ lxc exec centos6 bash
root@centos6 $ curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | bash -
root@centos6 $ yum -y install nodejs

```

### NFS Agents from Git Sandbox

Prereqs (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
# apt-get install -y nfs-client
# curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -
# sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Prereqs (RedHat/CentOS):
```bash
# curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | bash -
# yum -y install nodejs
```

/etc/exports:
```bash
/home/????/Documents/Brackets/partout/agent  172.16.0.0/16(ro)
```

On OpenStack guests:
```bash
# mkdir -p /opt/partout/agent
# mount -a
```

/etc/fstab:
```bash
??????:/home/????/Documents/Brackets/partout/agent  /opt/partout/agent nfs defaults,ro,intr 0 0
```
