Partout
=======

The goal is to develop a pure Javascript/Node.js DevOps Data and Event Driven Policy Based Configuration Management tool for the Internet of Everything.

"Partout" /pa Ätu/ - is french for "Everywhere"

\* THIS PROJECT IS UNDER INITIAL DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY FOR **ANY** FORM OF PRODUCTION USE YET \*

Licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3 - see [COPYING](./COPYING)).

ok, that's the boilerplate crud out of the way...

Features
--------

* Integration with operating system provided real-time notification of file system object changes (e.g. linux inotify) to trigger re-scan against policy - real-time repair...
* Policy files compile to native machine code at runtime (expressed as a DSL in Javascript under Node.js).

Master Platforms
----------------

Currently supporting:
* Linux

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v4 or above
* ArangoDB (master only) - for Gentoo use ebuild overlay https://github.com/gbevan/portage-arangodb-overlay

Agent Platforms
---------------

Platforms currently being developed and tested on are:

* Gentoo linux
* Ubuntu Linux (14.04 & 16.04)
* CentOS Linux (6 & 7)
* OpenSuse 13.2
* Oracle Linux (6 & 7)
* Microsoft Windows 10
* Raspberry Pi3 (Raspbian 8 jessie)

(see Agent and Unit-Testing Policies below...)

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v4 or above

P2 Language - Policy Files
--------------------------

p2 is a globally instantiated object from the P2 class, which is the agent Domain Specific Declarative Language.
This is implemented using chained javascript methods - and therefore policies are compiled to native machine code
at run time.

Typically a policy file takes the form of:

    p2
    .exec('cmd')
    .file('file-to-manage', content='whatever {{ Template}}', ...)
    .powershell('some powershell')
    ...
    ;

(See above Modules for details of the directives)

-------------------
* See [Anatomy of a Module](./docs/Anatomy_of_a_module.md)

Design / Proposal / Brain-Storm Documents
-----------------------------------------

* [PoC bootstrapping agents over a RESTful API](./agent/docs/shell_rest_notes.md)
* [Agent Event Sending Algorythmic Statistical Backoff for Scalability](./docs/Event_Sending_Statistical_Backoff.md)

Quick Sign All Agent CSRs
-------------------------

    bin/partout csr | grep unsigned | awk '{print $1;}' | xargs -i@ bin/partout csr sign @; bin/partout csr
