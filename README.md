Modules
-------

* [Facts](./agent/lib/modules/facts/README.md)
* [Exec](./agent/lib/modules/exec/README.md)
* [File](./agent/lib/modules/file/README.md)
* [Package](./agent/lib/modules/package/README.md)
* [Service](./agent/lib/modules/service/README.md)

### facts
Takes no parameters and is called internally before any other modules, to gather facts about the target system.

If any module contains a method called getFacts, it will be called during fact discovery, prior to module execution.

### exec
Execute commands.

### file
Manage files, includes the [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) templating library.

Discovered facts are made available to the templating engine.

P2 Language - Policy Files
--------------------------

P2 is a globally available class for expressing the Partout Domain Specific Language (DSL).

p2 is a globally instantiated object from the P2 class.

Anatomy of a Module
-------------------
(see docs/Anatomy_of_a_module.md)

* The constructor must be documented using jsdoc, with details of how the module isused. e.g.:
```javascript
    /**
     * @constructor
     * @description
     * Exec module
     * ===========
     *
     *     p2.node([...])
     *       .exec('a command', options, function (err, stdout, stderr) { ... });
     *
     * Options (from https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html):
     *
     *   | Operand    | Type   | Description                                                |
     *   |:-----------|--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
     *   | cwd        | String | Current working directory of the child process |
     *   | env        | Object | Environment key-value pairs |
     *   | encoding   | String | (Default: 'utf8') |
     *   | shell      | String | Shell to execute the command with (Default: '/bin/sh'
     *   |            |        | on UNIX, 'cmd.exe' on Windows, The shell should understand |
     *   |            |        | the -c switch on UNIX or /s /c on Windows. On Windows, |
     *   |            |        | command line parsing should be compatible with cmd.exe.) |
     *   | timeout    | Number | (Default: 0) |
     *   | maxBuffer  | Number | (Default: 200*1024) |
     *   | killSignal | String | (Default: 'SIGTERM') |
     *   | uid        | Number | Sets the user identity of the process. (See setuid(2).) |
     *   | gid        | Number | Sets the group identity of the process. (See setgid(2).) |
     * ...
     */
```

* Must provide method getName() which simply returns the P2 DSL command name, e.g.:
```javascript
    Exec.getName = function () { return 'exec'; };
```

* May optionally provide method getFacts() which will be called prior to P2 policy executions, to pre-gather facts. e.g.:
```javascript
    Exec.getFacts = function (facts_so_far) {
      var facts = {};
      facts.exec_loaded = true;
      return facts;
    };
```

  The passed facts_so_far parameter holds all the facts that have been gathered so far.  The facts.js module runs before all other modules to ensure it's facts are available.

* The module's constructor is called with the parameters passed from the P2 policy, e.g.:
```javascript
    p2
    .exec('runthis_cmd > newfile', {
      creates: 'newfile'
    }, function () {
      ... called when cmd has been run ...
    })
    ...
```

  The constructor in this case looks like this:
```javascript
    var Exec = function (cmd, opts, command_complete_cb) {
      var self = this;  // self is parents _impl
      ...

      return self;
    };
```

  The ```this``` (saved as ```self``` here) object is the P2 _impl object that provides the DSL, and MUST be returned by the constructor, as this passes on the DSL _impl for the next directive in the P2 policy.

* All actions initiated by the module's constructor MUST be pushed on the P2 _impl stack for serialised execution using the provided push_action() method, e.g.:

      self.push_action(function (next_step_callback) {

  The next_step_callback() is called to allow P2 DSL to move onto it's next serialised action for the policy.  It can be used to send a notification event back to the master on completion of this action, e.g.:
```javascript
      next_step_callback({
        module: 'exec',
        object: opts.creates,
        msg: 'target (re)created'
      });
```

  *NB: Be mindful that, even though actions are executed in a serialised manner by P2, they are actually being executed asyncronously and require that the next_step_callback() be called to move P2 onto the next action (or completion).

* If you need to do template expansion, use the provided Mustache library.
